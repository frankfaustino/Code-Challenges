 * Given a positive integer number (n), the Collatz conjecture determines the next term in the sequence by either
 * 1) Halving n if n is even
 * 2) Multiplying n by 3 and then adding one if n is odd
 * Write a function that will take a number n, and return the Collatz chain. You will stop at one
 * An example chain looks like this: [23, 70, 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
