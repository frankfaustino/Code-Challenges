# Doubly Linked List

Implement a doubly-linked list, where each node points to both the node after it in the list, as well as the node that came before it.

This challenge is difficult, but please put your best foot forward, as will every morning code challenge, to at the very least get pseudocode for how you would implement this data structure. Taking the easy route and just waiting for the solution without making any sort of attempt is not only a disservice to you but also to us, the instructors.

If questions arise while you're working on the challenge, please ask questions in the appropriate channels to get you unstuck.
