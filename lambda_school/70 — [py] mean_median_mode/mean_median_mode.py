'''
Write a function that given a list of numbers calculates the mean, median, and mode of those numbers.
Return a dictionary with properties for the mean, median and mode.

For example:

mmm_dict = meanMedianMode([1,2,6,7,8,9,3,4,5,10,10])

print(mmm_dict) should print:

{ 'mean': 5.909090909090909, 'median': 6, 'mode': 10 }

There are Python standard libraries that make calculating these numbers very easy,
but first try your hand at implementing a solution with only what has been imported for you.
