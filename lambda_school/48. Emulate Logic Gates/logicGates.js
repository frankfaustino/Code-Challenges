/* ———
 * For this coding challenge you will be emulating low level logic gates.
 * You're limited to only using the deep equality operator === and if (conditional) statements.
 * Do not use !, &&, or ||
 * Do not use the functions you have created to emulate any of the other logic gates,
 * e.g. don't use your NOT() function in the NAND() function.
 * The NOT() function only takes one parameter.
 * Your other functions will take two inputs and return a Boolean value which corresponds
 * to the conditions satisfied by their logical operator.
