 * The number 135 is particularly special in that if you take each digit, from left to right,
 * and you put them to the consecutive power.
 * Write a function sumDigitPower that takes in a starting number and an ending number,
 * and check every number in that range inclusive (including a and b) for this property.
 * a will be greater than or equal to 0. Return all these numbers in this range which
 * satisfies this property as an array.
 *
 * Example:
 * 135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3
 * 89 = 8^1 + 9^2
