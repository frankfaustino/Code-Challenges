# Calculator

Build a web calculator, that supports the basic operations of `add`, `remove`, `multiply` and `divide`.

In addition, support resetting the current state, as well as a decimal point button.

When you feel ready, you can validate your solution using any collaborative HTML/CSS renderer, such as [this one](https://codepen.io/pen/?editors=1000).
