# Form Validation
Build a simple sign up form, which collects a user’s:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email Address
- Password
- Password confirmation

Validate the form to allow submission. The validations should include common considerations, such as:

- No missing fields
- Valid email address
- String password
- Matching password

And any other validation you think is needed.

When you feel ready, you can validate your solution using any collaborative HTML/CSS renderer, such as [https://codepen.io/pen/?editors=1000](this one).

- Try and get your peer to first describe the validations they intend to perform
- Make sure your peer doesn’t submit the form if it’s not valid
- While other forms of validation are ok, suggest to your peer to perform the validation without any specific framework

[Here](https://codepen.io/prampcontent/pen/WgepzQ)’s an example of a simple validation form, with some (non-critical) assistance from jquery and bootstrap.

A few points to notice:

- inputs are being validated both on submission and on input.
- feedback is given to the user in real time.
- requirements that aren’t obvious (i.e. password) are explicitly stated.
