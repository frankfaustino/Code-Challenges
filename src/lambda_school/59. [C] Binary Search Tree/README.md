# Binary Search Tree

Implement a binary search tree node struct along with the following methods:

- `newNode`: Creates a new binary search tree node
- `insert`: Inserts a new node in the binary search tree
- `printInOrder`: Given a root node, print the root node's value and all of its children's values in ascending order. For example, given the tree

```
                 10
                /  \
               7    19
              / \   / \
             6   9 11  20
```

`printInOrder` should print: `6  7  9  10  11  19  20`
