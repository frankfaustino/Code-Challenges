 * Businesses often try to come up with clever ways to spell out their phone
 * number in advertisements to make it more memorable. But there are a lot of
 * combinations!

 * Write a function that takes up to four digits of a phone number, and returns
 * a list of all of the words that can be written on the phone with that number.
 * (You should return all permutations, not only English words.) 

 — Phone numbers are strings! (A phone number can start with a zero.) 
 — The digits 0 and 1 do not have letters associated with them, so they should
   be left as numbers. 
 — Don't return every combination of those digits in any order, just the order given.

 * Example:
 * '45' -> [ 'GJ', 'GK', 'GL', 'HJ', 'HK', 'HL', 'IJ', 'IK', 'IL' ]
 * '905' -> [ 'W0J', 'W0K', 'W0L', 'X0J', 'X0K', 'X0L', 'Y0J', 'Y0K', 'Y0L', 'Z0J', 'Z0K', 'Z0L' ]
