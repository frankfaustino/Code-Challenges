# Overlapping Rectangles

Write a function `findOverlap` to find the rectangular intersection of two given rectangles. All values are positive and non-zero. They are defined as objects like this:

```js
const rectangle1 = {
  leftX: 1,
  bottomY: 5,
  width: 10,
  height: 4,
}
```

Your function should return an object in this format as well. In the case they don't overlap, all values in the object returned should be `null`.
