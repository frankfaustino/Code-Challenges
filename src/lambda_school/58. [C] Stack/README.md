# Stack

Implement a stack data structure.

You're provided with a struct representing the `Stack`, the `createStack` method, and a `main` function. Note how the `createStack` function allocates memory in order to initialize a new stack structure.

Implement the methods `isFull`, `isEmpty`, `push`, and `pop`.

When the stack reaches its capacity, have it double in capacity so as to be able to accommodate additional inputs. Look into the `realloc` method as a possible way to do this.
