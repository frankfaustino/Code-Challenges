# Linked List

It's time to implement a linked list in Python!

The main takeaway of this exercise is to delve into classes and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. 

We'll start off by defining a Node class. Each linked list node will be an instance of a Node. 

OOP in Python is very similar to what you've seen in JavaScript. The main surface-level differences are that, in Python, the class constructor method is called `__init__`, and also that every class method accepts `self` as its first input parameter, in order to delineate to the Python interpreter that it is a class method instead of a regular function. Lastly, there is no `new` keyword in Python that is needed to instantiate a new class instance. We would just define a new node with something like 
`new_node = Node(data)`.

Note that when we invoke a class method, you don't actually pass `self` into the class method. For example, if we want to instantiate a new Node instance, we can do that with `new_node = Node(data)`, where data is the piece of data we want the Node to hold. We don't need to actually pass in some context as the first parameter.
