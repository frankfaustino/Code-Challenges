# Code Challenges


This initially began as a "100 Days of Code" personal challenge, where I would complete a code challenge from codewars, hackerrank and the like every day for 100 days straight. Now it's just a repository of code challenges that I've completed. Sort of like a diary, where I look back at past entries and cringe. ðŸ˜¬

If you'd like to give the challenges a shot read the usage instructions below. I've included unit tests for some of the challenges.

#### Usage:

1. `cd` into the directory of your choice.  
2. Read through the challenge `README.md`.  
3. Solve the challenge in the corresponding `js` or `py` file.
4. Test your solution:

JavaScript
```
npm test <filename>
```
or Python
```
python tests/<filename>
```

#### Example:

1. `cd src/codesignal/company_challenges/Uber/parkingSpot/`
2. Read the `README.md`  
3. Add your solution code to `parkingSpot.js`
4. `npm test parkingSpot`
