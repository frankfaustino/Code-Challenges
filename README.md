# Code Challenges


This initially began as a "100 Days of Code" personal challenge, where I would complete a code challenge from codewars, hackerrank and the like. Now it's just a repository of code challenges that I've completed. Sort of like a diary, where I look back at past entries and cringe. ðŸ˜¬
